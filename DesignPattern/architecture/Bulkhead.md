# Bulkhead
Bulkhead isolates critical resources, such as connection pool, memory, and CPU, for each workload or service. By using bulkheads, a single workload (or service) canâ€™t consume all of the resources, starving others. This pattern increases the resiliency of the system by preventing cascading failures caused by one service.
